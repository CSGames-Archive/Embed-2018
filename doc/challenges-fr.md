# Challenges

## Scoring

Each challenge (bonuses included) final score is evaluated with the following table.

| Work for all inputs | Resources used  | Number of cycles  | total  |
|:-----------------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|:-----:|
| bool                | %                | %                Â |       |
| 80                  | 10               | 10                | 100   |

That percentage is then multiplied to the question value to get a number of point.
The final score is the sum of all those points.

Challenges will be tested with inputs different from the ones given as example in this document.

Objectives may be of different types:
- bool: You either get all the point or none at all.
- %: The best competitor get all the point, the worst, none.
Every one else score is given by a linear interpolation between the two extremes.
- pts: The competitor with the most point will win the challenge.

Definitions:

- Number of cycles: Number of cycles to get an output for all the test inputs.
- Resources used: `(number of membanks) x (size of membanks) + cores`



## 1. Value passing (10 pts)

### Restrictions

```
- Two inputs (a, b)
- Two outputs (A, B)
```

### Description

Move values from the two inputs to the two outputs (`A=a, B=b`).

### Example inputs
Inputs:
```
235 225
87  128
162 156
242 220
81  46
15  233
192 126
62  79
100 2
140 65
```

Outputs:
```
235 225
87  128
162 156
242 220
81  46
15  233
192 126
62  79
100 2
140 65
```


### Bonus (5 pts)

Move values from the two inputs to the two outputs but cross them so that `A=b, B=a`.


## 2. Simple sum (10 pts)

### Restrictions

```
- Two inputs (a, b)
- One output (A)
```

### Description

Add values from the two inputs and return the result to the single output (`A=a+b`).
Output should wrap if it exceeds maximum.

### Example inputs
Input:
```
0   0
0   1
153 108
250 224
16  176
109 18
203 78
143 19
141 71
228 145
```

Output:
```
0
1
5
218
192
127
25
162
212
117
```


### Bonus (10 pts)

Do the same but with 16 bits little endian numbers.
You most therefore have four inputs (a, b, c, d) and 2 outputs such as:
```
result = b << 8 | a + d << 8 | c
A = result & 0xff
B = result >> 8
```


# 3. Conditional negation (20 pts)

### Restrictions

```
- Three inputs (a, b, c)
- One output (A)
```

### Description
Output `A` must be `c` when `a < b`, `0` when `a = b` and `-c` when a > b

### Example inputs
Input:
```
232 4 35
222 75 35
48 48 35
145 123 35
71 248 35
28 64 35
86 251 35
43 0 35
252 196 35
64 192 0
```

Output:
```
221
221
0
221
35
35
35
221
221
0
```

Note: Simulator does not know whether its output is a signed or unsigned number and therefore always display them as unsigned.
For example, 221 is `0b11011101` which is -35 when interpreted as a signed 8 bits number.

### Bonus (5 pts)
Output `max(A, B)` when `a = b`.


# 4. Parallel base 2 logarithm (20 pts)

### Restrictions

```
- Three inputs (a, b, c)
- Three outputs (A, B, C)
```

### Description

Compute the base-2 logarithm for all inputs such as
```
A = floor(log2(a))
B = floor(log2(b))
C = floor(log2(c))
```


### Example inputs
Input:
```
113 167 204
21  57  26
201 121 204
```

Output:
```
6 7 7
4 5 4
7 6 7
```

### Bonus (5 pts)

Compute base-16 logarithms instead of base-2 logarithms.


## 5. Multiplication (30 pts)

### Restrictions

```
- Two inputs (A, B)
- One output (a)
```

### Description

Perform `a = A * B`. Overflows most wrap around.

### Example inputs
Input:
```
0 3
0 0
6 8
3 32
79 39
66 56
```

Output:
```
0
0
48
96
21
126
```


## 6. Gaussian blur

### Restrictions
```
- 900 inputs (A)
- 900 outputs (a)
```

### Description

Given a 30x30 input image, output a 30x30 blurred image using the following kernel.
```
1/16 1/8 1/16
1/8  1/4 1/8
1/16 1/8 1/16
```

Such as
$$\begin{split}
a_{i,j} =
1/16 A_{i-1,j-1} + 1/8 A_{i-1,j} + 1/16 A_{i-1,j+1} + \\
1/8 A_{i,j-1} + 1/4 A_{i,j} + 1/8 A_{i,j+1} + \\
1/16 A_{i+1,j-1} + 1/8 A_{i+1,j} + 1/16 A_{i+1,j+1} + \\
\end{split}$$

This challenge is special, for two reasons:
1. Its the first challenge which you should probably solve using a 3D CPU.
I suggest using a Zx30x30 CPU with all cores on the first Z-layer used as inputs and all cores on the last Z-layer used as outputs.
Z is up to you. You may use a few intermediate z-layers to perform your calculations.

2. CPU configuration is tedious.
Sadly, as today, the simulator does not support range input. Therefore, to use 900 inputs, you must list all of them.
The same limitation applies to outputs and core_to_mem.
Please, does not try to list everything by hand and instead use a tool like Python to generate those lists for you.
Here are some examples to base your work on:

```python3
# Print a list of 900 elements in the format accepted by the LAVAL simulator
print(", ".join([str(i) for i in range(900)]))

# Print every cores ID part of the second column of the first layer
print(", ".join([str(i) for i in range(1, 30*30, 30)]))
```


### Example inputs

Too big to include here.
