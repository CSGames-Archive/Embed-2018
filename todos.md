# TODO
- Run tests on ARM
- Test with clang
- As most older 8 bits CPU, consider if using some 16 bits registers could prove useful
- I/O
- Cpu class

# Tests/challenges idea
- Multiply test:
    c ← 0
    while b ≠ 0
        if (b and 1) ≠ 0
            c ← c + a
        left shift a by 1
        right shift b by 1
    return c

- Float
- 16 bits add
